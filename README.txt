# Educational project for basic html+css

It is my first landing page, I made it while learning html and css technology, it is simpl page but it was interesting and informative for me. This is not a big project that shows my skill in web page layout. 

On the example of this landing, I tried to make an adaptive, cross-browser, semantically correct page, I used the BEM methodology to name the classes. I also showed how I can work with styles, fonts, icons, favicons, SVG, Canvas and animation. Using the slick plugin, I implemented the slider and the jQuery library also helped me make a popup window for filling out the feedback form.
